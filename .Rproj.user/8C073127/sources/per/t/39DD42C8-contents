# About Me 
## My name is Nolan Dulude I currently live in Cincinnati Ohio where I work at Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a Clinical Manufacturing Technician for the Experimental Hematology group. What that means I assist in the manufacturing of gene therapies within a cleanroom for sponsors that are currently in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials. This line of work is very rewarding  because I can see the impact that they make on the patients lives that go through the clinical trials. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelors of Science in Chemistry and a Minor in biology in 2017. I am currently pursuing a Master in Data Science at Southern Methodist University.
