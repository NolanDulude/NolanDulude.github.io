My name is Nolan Dulude. I live in Cincinnati Ohio, and I work at Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital as a Clinical Manufacturing Technician for the Experimental Hematology group. This means that I assist in the manufacturing of gene therapies within a cleanroom for sponsors that are currently in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials. This line of work is very rewarding because I can see the impact that they make on the patients' lives that go through the clinical trials. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelors of Science in Chemistry and a Minor in biology in 2017. I am currently pursuing a Master in Data Science at Southern Methodist University.
